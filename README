**How to compile**
For Searches.java ---> java Searches.java
For searchTestClass.java ---> javac searchTestClass.java
For GenericArrayList.java ---> javac GenericArrayList.java
For ArrayListTestClass.java ---> javac ArrayListTestClass.java
(Note: when you compile the classes, you will receive warning about unchecked or unsafe operations)

---------------------------------------------------------------
**How to run** 
(Note: only have to run test classes, and use command-line to pass file name to args[0])
For searchTestClass.java ---> java searchTestClass _______
For ArrayListTestClass.java ---> java ArrayListTestClass ________ 

**In blank space, type the text file name**

Test programs will use three different text files: 
	1.american-words.35
	2.american-words.80
	3.dictionary.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------
**What will be printed when running test programs**
(For searchTestClass)
When you run searchTestClass, it will first print "Word to search for: ", then user would type a word that they want to search for. 

If the word is found, then it will print "linearSearch says true, word exists, found at index (wherever) and binarySearch says true, the word exists" 

If the word is not found, then it will asks the user "word not found, would you like to search for another word? (y/n)". If the user types "y", then it will repeat from the beginning. If the user types "n", the program terminates. 

(For ArrayListTestClass)
When you run ArrayListTestClass, it will first print "Word to search for: ", then suer would type a word that they want to search for.

If the word is found, then it will print "word exists, it is at index (wherever)". If the word is not found, then it will ask "word not found, would you like to search for another word? (y/n)". If user types "n", then program terminates. If user types "y" program restarts.
